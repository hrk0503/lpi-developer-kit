## B. LLM Output

I used a local LLM model through Ollama to understand the SMILE methodology and digital twin concepts.

The model explained that SMILE (Sustainable Methodology for Impact Lifecycle Enablement) focuses on building meaningful and impactful digital twin solutions. Instead of just collecting large amounts of data, it emphasizes understanding the real-world system first, then designing solutions that create measurable impact.

It also highlighted that each phase of SMILE—from reality emulation to implementation—helps ensure that the solution is practical, efficient, and aligned with real-world needs.

## C. Model Choice

I used a lightweight local model (via Ollama) because:
- It runs efficiently on my system
- It does not require external APIs
- It provides fast and reliable responses

## D. Reflection (SMILE)

1. I realized that before applying AI, it is important to understand the real-world system properly through digital twins.  
2. I found it interesting that SMILE focuses on impact rather than just collecting data.  
3. I learned that local AI models can be powerful and useful without depending on external services.

## E. What I Did

1. I cloned the repository and installed all dependencies using `npm install`.  
2. I built the project using `npm run build`.  
3. I ran the test client using `npm run test-client` and verified that all tools passed successfully.  
4. I set up a local LLM using Ollama and used it to explore SMILE concepts.  

## F. Problem Faced

Initially, the Ollama command was not recognized in the terminal.  
I resolved this by restarting the terminal, after which it worked properly.
