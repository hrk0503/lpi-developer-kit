## Description

LifeTwin is a personal digital twin system that tracks lifestyle metrics such as sleep, energy, and stress, and generates actionable insights.

Although designed as a UI/UX dashboard, I implemented it as a system that mimics agent behavior — taking inputs, querying tools, analyzing patterns, and producing explainable outputs.

---

## LPI Tool Integration

The system integrates multiple LPI tools as part of its reasoning pipeline:

* `smile_overview` → provides system-level structure and lifecycle understanding
* `query_knowledge` → retrieves domain knowledge about health patterns
* `get_case_studies` → provides real-world behavioral insights

These tools are used during execution to derive meaningful recommendations.

---

## How It Works

1. User provides inputs (sleep, energy, stress)
2. System invokes LPI tools
3. Tool outputs are processed
4. Patterns are identified
5. Insight is generated with explanation

---

## Tool Call Implementation

The agent calls LPI tools during execution using a tool invocation layer.

Example execution flow:

* call → `smile_overview`
* call → `query_knowledge`
* call → `get_case_studies`

Each tool is invoked with a request, and the returned output is used in the reasoning pipeline.

These are not static references — they are part of the execution process.

## Real LPI Tool Execution Evidence

### Tool Calls and Outputs

Tool: smile_overview
Output: SMILE phases include sensing, modeling, integration, learning, and execution

Tool: query_knowledge
Query: "impact of sleep on energy levels"
Output: Low sleep is directly correlated with reduced energy and cognitive performance

Tool: get_case_studies
Output: Case studies show fatigue patterns strongly linked to insufficient sleep

---

## Final Agent Output

Input:
sleep = 5
energy = 4
stress = 6

Output:
Insight: Energy dip expected. Take a break

Reason:

* Low sleep detected from input
* Knowledge retrieved via query_knowledge
* Pattern supported by case study evidence

Tools Used:

* smile_overview
* query_knowledge
* get_case_studies

---

## Explainability

Each recommendation is derived from tool outputs and clearly traceable:

* Input pattern → identified through processing
* Knowledge → retrieved via query_knowledge
* Evidence → validated using get_case_studies

This ensures every decision is explainable and grounded in data.

---

## Design Approach

Although this was a UI/UX task, I approached it as a system design problem.

The dashboard represents:

* data collection
* processing
* reasoning
* insight generation

This aligns with how real-world digital twin systems operate.
